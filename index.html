Ramiro Arellano
First off, I will finish my BAIS degree by the end of 2026. That is my #1 priority at the moment, and my number one goal that I want to complete. So far, life has been a roller coaster to say the least, so I feel like this career goal has put me on a more stable path for my future earnings. Another valuable aspect to take into consideration is how I can increase my future earnings as much as I can right now. A long-term goal that I have in mind is I want to be seen as a leader in my profession who is able to influence people for the greater good. For me, this will showcase my passion for the field I chose and demonstrate to others I'm willing to lend a hand when someone's in need.
